There are several different sources of placement error in a pick and place system, and the LumenPnP is no different. Fortunately, most of these issues only need to be addressed once, and so once you've successfully placed components on your FTP, you'll have done the vast majority of the setup work needed to fine-tune your machine. After that, populating new PCBs on your LumenPnP will simply be a matter of setting up the board and feeder locations.

Hopefully, you'll see a pattern to the placement errors on your machine. If that's the case, look at the list of Symptoms and narrow down the possible causes so that you only have to check some of the [Solutions]({{< relref "solutions" >}}).
