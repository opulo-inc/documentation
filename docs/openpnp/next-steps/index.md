# Next Steps

Congratulations! Your machine now has basic calibration complete. There are still many metrics to tweak and adjust as you go through the process of placing your first board. OpenPnP is a large and complex piece of software, and it will take time to get used to it.

The following links are OpenPnP documentation pages that will help you confirm that your calibration is complete and accurate, and get a job loaded up and running.

[`Issues and Solutions`](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Issues-and-Solutions)
:  OpenPnP has a wonderful "Issues and Solutions" tab that will help you further calibrate your LumenPnP. It's highly recommended that you complete the "Calibrations Milestone" prior to using your LumenPnP in production, and that you explore all of the edits that it recommends you make.

[`Job Setup`](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/User-Manual#job-setup)
:  This is an incredibly useful document, illustrating the difference between parts, packages, and placements, and how to import information about your parts into the software. It shows the UI and explains what lots of things do, along with walking you through setting up a job. There's also information about setting up feeders. We recommend using the ReferenceTrayFeeder and ReferenceStripFeeder. Soon we'll have our own powered feeder for the LumenPnP, which will have a selectable feeder type in OpenPnP, but that's still to come.

[`Mods`](https://mods.opulo.io/)
:  Many folks in the community have developed mods and upgrades to the machine that are all organized here.

[`Qwertymodo Full Calibration Video`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuFalyzcCZA)
:  Community member Qwertymodo has put together a video of doing his calibration from scratch, instead of using the OpenPnP config files in the repository as a starting point. Many folks in the community have found it very useful, especially for understanding all the menus and features OpenPnP has to offer.
