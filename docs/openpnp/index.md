# OpenPnP

OpenPnP is a piece of open source software designed to control pick and place machines. It supports a wide range of machines, with many features found in high-end commercial software. You can find out more about it [here](https://openpnp.org/).

These guides were designed with OpenPnP version `2022-08-01_18-07-09.2a36a8d` in mind, but they should work for other version as well.
