# Wiring

In this step, you will mount and connect all the wiring and pneumatic tubing.

1. Find the `front-drag-chain-mount` print in the first tray, and grab an M5x25mm and M5x16mm socket head screw from the hardware bag.

1.  Plug the cable labeled `RH` into the right motor on the X gantry. This cable is inserted from the bottom.
  ![](images/plug-rh.JPG)

1.  Find the two pieces of tubing labeled `LH` and `RH`, and insert `LH` into the left motor, and `RH` into the right motor. Make sure that the tubing is in between the `LH` and `RH` cable harness going to the motors as shown in the image below.
  ![](images/tubing.JPG)
  ![](images/tubing-inserted.JPG)

1.  Your X gantry should look like the image below.
  ![](images/finished-head.JPG)

1.  Take the print attached to the wire exiting from the middle of the cable chain, and align it with the back of the X motor as shown in the image below.
  ![](images/x-umbilical.JPG)

1.  Using two M5x16mm socket head screws, mount the X cable guide to the Y gantry. Then plug the cable into the X motor.
  ![](images/x-umbilical-mount.JPG)

1.  Remove the motherboard cover by unscrewing any screws, lifting the top edge away from the board, and rotating it out from underneath the pneumatic tubing.
  ![](images/cover-remove-1.JPG)
  ![](images/cover-remove-2.JPG)
  ![](images/cover-remove-3.JPG)

1.  Take the `Y1` cable harness that came attached to the left leg assembly and guide it underneath the motherboard from the left side, and out through the top as shown. Plug the connector into the second port from the left and tuck any excess cabling underneath the motherboard.
  ![](images/route-y1.JPG)
  ![](images/plug-y1.JPG)

1.  Using the cable clips as shown below, guide the `Y2` cable harness from the right leg assembly across the top of the staging plate, under the motherboard, and out through the top. You'll have to loosen the clips using an allen key to get the cable underneath them. Be sure to clamp them down tight so the cable doesn't hang loosely.
  ![](images/route-y2-1.JPG)
  ![](images/route-y2-2.JPG)
  ![](images/route-y2-3.JPG)
  ![](images/route-y2-4.JPG)

1.  Plug the `Y2` cable harness into the third port from the left. Tuck any excess cabling underneath the motherboard.
  ![](images/plug-y2.JPG)

1.  Take a look at the bundle of cables coming from the cable chain. One cable with a USB connector will not be zip tied into the print. Move this cable out of the way for now, as we won't be routing it with the rest of the cables.
  ![](images/isolate-top-cam.JPG)

1.  Isolate the following items from the bundle, and guide them under the motherboard from the left side, and out through the top as shown below.
    - `RH` tubing
    - `LH` tubing
    - `XM` cable harness
    - `ZM` cable harness
    - `LM` cable harness
  ![](images/isolate-half-1.JPG)
  ![](images/isolate-half-2.JPG)

1.  Plug the `XM` cable harness into the first port from the left (labeled "X"), plug the `ZM` cable harness into the fourth port from the left (labeled "Z"), and plug the `LM` cable harness into the port on the far left (labeled "L").
  ![](images/plug-xm.JPG)
  ![](images/plug-zm.JPG)
  ![](images/plug-lm.JPG)

1.  Take the two tubes left and stick them back under the motherboard, out the right side, and plug them into the pneumatic fitting that matches the label on the tubing.
  ![](images/guide-tubing-1.JPG)
  ![](images/guide-tubing-2.JPG)
  ![](images/plug-tubing.JPG)

1.  With the remaining three cable harness from the bundle, plug the harness labeled `RM` into the first port in the second row (labeled "R"), plug the harness labeled `ZL` into the Z Limit Switch port, and plug the harness labeled `DL` into the Top Light port.
  ![](images/plug-rm.JPG)
  ![](images/plug-zl.JPG)
  ![](images/plug-dl.JPG)

1.  Tuck any excess cabling underneath the motherboard. Your machine should look like the image below.
  ![](images/wired-overview.JPG)

1.  Attach the strain relief print into the bottom of the bottom rail in the left leg assembly.
  ![](images/mount-strain.JPG)

1.  Fit the cover back onto the motherboard by rotating it underneath the pneumatic tubing, and pressing down around the stepper driver pins and heatsinks. Remount using the hardware it was originally mounted with.
  ![](images/mount-cover-1.JPG)
  ![](images/mount-cover-2.JPG)
  ![](images/mount-cover-3.JPG)

1.  Grab the USB <-> 4 pin connector cable from your tool bag, and plug the 4 pin connector into the back of the bottom camera. Attach the cable to the bottom camera mount using a zip tie and snip off the excess.
  ![](images/plug-bottom-cam.JPG)
  ![](images/zip-bottom-cam.JPG)

1.  Find the staging plate foot from the second tray, and press fit it onto the bottom camera mount, taking care to align the cutout with the bottom camera cable.
  ![](images/mount-foot-1.JPG)
  ![](images/mount-foot-2.JPG)

1.  Route the USB cable underneath the motherboard.
  ![](images/usb-under-mobo.JPG)
  ![](images/final-wiring.JPG)

1.  Plug the power supply into a wall outlet, and plug the barrel jack into the port in the upper-right corner of the motherboard. You should see a light come on underneath the cover.
2.  Plug the USB-B cable located in your tool bag into the USB port on the bottom-left corner of the motherboard.
3.  Lower your machine down onto all four legs.
4.  Plug the three USB cables coming from your machine into your computer. Depending on your computer's hardware, you might need to plug these all into separate USB ports on your computer and not use an external hub. We'll cover more about this later during calibration.

5.  You're done with your build! Time to head over to the OpenPnP section of the docs for calibration and running your first job:
