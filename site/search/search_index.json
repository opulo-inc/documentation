Qty Part 1 GT2 Timing Belt 4 FDM-0027 (Belt Clamp) 8 M5x10 machine screw We'll start with the Y axis. If you'd like to precut your belt instead of routing the entirety of it through the machine, you can cut two 1400mm lengths for the Y axis motors. To help guide the belt through the openings in the prints, bend it backwards as shown below so that the belt has a curve to it. } Take your length of GT2 belt and stick it inside the extrusion (smooth side facing outward), behind the `Y Gantry\" \"FDM-0005\" >}} as shown below. Getting the belt to come out of the slot in the Y axis gantry can be difficult. Here's some strategies: Try using a small allen wrench with a ball tip to guide the belt out of the hole. (Photos below) Or, attach a twist tie to the end of the belt and guide that out the hole instead. When you're done, the belt should be coming out of the hole on the side closest to the front of the machine. Running a long zip tie through the hole from the front, you may be able to catch the ridges of the zip tie with the ridges of the belt, and pull it through by retracting the zip tie. } Using 4 M5x10mm machine screws and 2 Belt Clamps\" \"FDM-0027\" >}} on the Y Gantry\" \"FDM-0005\" >}}, slide the belt underneath the Belt Clamps\" \"FDM-0027\" >}} and tighten them down with the GT2 belt flush with the edge of the Y Gantry\" \"FDM-0005\" >}}. Now, take the other end of your belt and feed it through the Front Right Leg . Guide it through and around the idler in the Belt Tension Arm , and feed it back through the other side of the Front Right Leg as shown below. } Continue to feed your belt along the inner side of the aluminum extrusion. Pass behind the `Y Gantry Support\" \"FDM-0008\" >}}\u2014between it and the aluminum extrusion. Feed the belt through the inner side of the Back Right Leg\" \"FDM-0004\" >}}. Then loop the belt around the GT2 pulley on the stepper motor and feed it through the outer side of the Back Right Leg\" \"FDM-0004\" >}}. ![](images/IMG_0715.JPG\" alt=\"Looping the belt around one of the Y axis motors\" >}} Run the belt along the outer side of the aluminum extrusion. Take the end and feed it through the other opening of the Y gantry, like we did in step 1. Feed the end between the Y gantry and the `Belt Clamps\" \"FDM-0027\" >}}. Make sure the belt tensioner on the front leg is completely unscrewed, meaning it's angled as close to the leg as it can be. This will give us the most possible stroke to tension the belt in the next step. Pull on the belt with one hand, while holding the Y gantry steady with the other. Getting it generally taught is preferable, but don't worry about getting it perfect; we'll tension it correctly next. Push down on the belt clamp to hold the belt in place, and tighten the two screws to clamp it down. Cut the belt with at least 20mm remaining out the back side of the Y gantry. Now we can tension the belt. Slowly tighten in the M3 screw on the belt tensioner to increase the belt tension. Pulling back on the belt tensioner arm should be difficult, but possible. A tug should result in only a 2mm deflection. Perform the same steps on the left side Y axis. ![](images/Attaching-Belts-Step-8.png\" alt=\"Overview of attaching the belt to the left Y axis\" >}} We're going to do the exact same operation for the X axis, but with one small thing to keep in mind: when looking at the back of the machine, start by clamping the belt on the right side of the X gantry (the side closest to the motor). This way, the excess belt will be sticking out of the X gantry on the side opposite of the limit switch, and prevent a problem with homing. You can precut a 1500mm strip of belt for the X axis or just use the rest of your belt and trim the excess. ![](images/Attaching-Belts-Step-9.png\" alt=\"Overview of attaching the belt to the X axis\" >}} Next steps Continue to populating the staging plate .","title":"Attaching Belts"},{"location":"byop/mechanical-assembly/attaching-belts/#next-steps","text":"Continue to populating the staging plate .","title":"Next steps"},{"location":"byop/mechanical-assembly/belt-tensioners/","text":"Belt Tensioners Alright, time to get into the build!

You can find the parts you need on the Releases Page , and look at the attached Assets at the bottom of the release. Click and download both LumenPnP-STLs and LumenPnP-BOM to get the STL files and BOM for your machine. Printer Requirements These parts are designed to fit onto a printer with a build volume of at least 18 x 18 x 18 cm, such as the Prusa MINI. Although not recommended, it's possible to print the parts on a smaller printer with some creative placements. Additionally these parts are designed for printers with a 0.4mm nozzle. Using a larger nozzle diameter can result in some features not resolving correctly, or parts not fitting as designed. Material These parts are designed for PLA, however, some folks have printed the parts successfully with PETG. You'll need about 1 kg of the primary filament. There are three situations where you'll need specific filament colors: White or transparent filament for the light mounts, top-light-mount and bottom-light-mount . These parts act as light diffusers for the ring lights. White or light colored filament for the nozzle-rack . This helps with setting up the automatic tool changer. A darker filament for the Z gantries, z-gantry-left and z-gantry-right . This helps the bottom camera distinguish the nozzle tip from the rest of the gantry. If you print in a lighter color anyway you can use a bit of blue painter's table on the bottom side of the gantry. Print settings There are two different print setting profiles you'll need for printing the parts. We use PrusaSlicer's setting names, but you should be able to adapt them if you use a different slicer. Every printer is a little different, but these settings should be a reasonable starting point. You can tune them as needed once you print the calibration print in the next step. Default Settings These settings are used for the majority of the parts: Layer height : 0.2 mm Vertical shells > Perimeters : 3 Infill > Fill density : 20% Horizontal shells > Solid Layers : 5 for top and bottom Support material > Generate support material : yes Gantry Settings These settings are used for parts that require more strength: Layer height : 0.2 mm Vertical shells > Perimeters : 4 Infill > Fill density : 30% Horizontal shells > Solid Layers : 5 for top and bottom Support material > Generate support material : yes Use gantry settings for the following parts: y-gantry y-gantry-support roller-spacer x-gantry-front x-gantry-back x-idler-mount z-gantry-left z-gantry-right Calibration Print Before printing the parts, print the calibration part . This part contains every feature- screw holes, nut slots, extrusion profiles, etc.- used in the printable parts. Printing this first ensures your printer calibration and print settings are correct. This is the calibration print , colloquially referred to as \"the corndog\" . This part isn't currently included in the exported STLs, so grab it from the link above. After printing, you can check fit of various fasteners and one of the aluminum extrusions to ensure the parts you print will all fit as expected: Check that M3 and M5 bolts fit through their counter-sunk holes. Check that M3 and M5 nuts fit in both hexagonal voids and vertical nut slots. Check that M3 and M5 bolts can be self-tap through the two holes inside the lock icon. They should take some effort, but they should grip well into the print. Check that the 20 x 20 mm aluminum extrusion fits into the square hole. Once you're happy with the fit you can start printing the parts. Printing The Parts You can find out how many of each part to print in the LumenPnP-BOM zip file you downloaded in the first step. After unzipping, open the HTML file in your browser to see the machine's Bill of Materials. The \"Part Name\" column will tell you which part to print and the \"Quantity\" column will tell you how many to print. There's a rendered image of each 3D printed part as well to help identify them. Just print the parts that have the \"Part Type\" of \"FDM\". The other items in this table are a list of all the other fasteners, hardware, and off the shelf parts used in the machine's mechanical build- all of these have been provided in the kit. The 3d models are already in the preferred orientation for printing, so you only need to make sure they're placed within the build volume when slicing. Optional Parts There are some parts in the Bill of Materials page that are highlighted and flagged as optional. These prints are not necessary to print - feel free to print them if you think they'll be useful for you, but they aren't required for building the machine. There are notes in the BOM about what extra parts and steps are necessary to use them.

The off-center port is the one that provides vacuum. Start by cutting a 65mm section of the 6mm clear tubing and pushing it onto the off-center port on the vacuum pump. Push the other end onto the inline plastic port of the valve as shown below. Cut a 230mm section of the 6mm clear tubing and push it onto the right-angle plastic port of the valve, and push the other side into the single, larger port of the Y splitter. Switch to using the smaller, 4mm black tubing. Cut a 235mm length of 4mm OD tubing and push one side into a fork of the Y splitter, and route the other end underneath the motherboard and onto the VAC1 sensor port. {{< alert color=\"info\" title=\"Keep In Mind\" >}} This sensor is only attached to the motherboard with six solder joints. Be gentle when pushing the tubing onto it. Twisting the tubing back and forth as you push it down can help get it on without too much force. {{< /alert >}} Plumbing the X gantry Now take the remaining length of 4mm black tubing and push it into the other fork of the Y splitter. Take the loose end, and route it underneath the motherboard, then up through all the zip ties that are holding the X umbilical in place, including those along the swivel arm. Now that the pneumatics are also routed, we can finally tighten the zip ties on the umbilical cable guide. While your machine is still back on its haunches, tighten the zip tie on the umbilical guide to secure the wires and tubing to the frame. Bring your LumenPnP down onto its four legs, and tighten the zip ties, ensuring to keep a bit of slack between sections. You can move up the umbilical swivel and tighten all the zip ties along the whole thing.

Tools Needed Hot Air Gun Soldering Iron Tweezers Solder Solder Wick 2x Interposer PCBAs Your REV03 Motherboard Installation If your board looks like the image below, then you do not have the interposers installed, and this guide is for you! If your vacuum sensors have a little green board between them and the motherboard, you're all set and don't need to perform this installation . First, you'll need to remove the existing vacuum sensors. You'll find them near the USB-C connector labeled \"VAC1\" and \"VAC2\". Using your hot air gun, apply heat to the legs of one of the vacuum sensors on your motherboard. Wait until you see the solder become molten and shiny, then gently remove the sensor from the PCB using tweezers. Perform the same operation for the second sensor. Warning Be careful not to tug too hard on the sensor. It's held down to the PCB with just a few copper pads, and pulling too hard might result in lifting those pads off the PCB. Make sure the solder is completely molten and the sensor should come away easily. Remove any remaining solder on the vacuum sensor pads. The pads need to be cleaned and flat for the interposer installation. Use solder wick (and flux if necessary) to remove any solder from the six pads that make up each vacuum sensor footprint. Clean up any excess flux or solder residue. Now you can install an interposer board. First, make sure you have the correct board orientation. The bottom of the board has six pads that match the vacuum sensor footprint on the board. Make sure they line up with the footprint and that a bit of the interposer board is hanging off of the edge of the motherboard. Correct orientation Make sure the six pads of the footprint on the motherboard align with the six plated edges of the interposer board. Add a bit of solder to one of the pads on the motherboard, and tack the interposer in place with a bit of solder on one of the pads. Apply heat to this joint while you align the interposer board using your tweezers. Once your board is aligned with the pads and tacked in place, apply solder to the remaining five pads. Make sure that you have a good fillet of solder connecting the interposer board to the pad on the motherboard. Repeat steps 4 and 5 with the second interposer board and the second vacuum footprint on the motherboard. Check to make sure that the sensor is working properly. Connect to the motherboard with your computer and try sending some GCode commands to it with a GCode sender. We recommend using CNCjs . First sensor command: M3426 G2 C1 I1 A110 Second sensor command: M3426 G2 C2 I1 A110 When at ambient pressure, the response from each sensor should look something like this: V:29800 C:1 G:2 I:1 Make sure the V value is about 29800 . Don't worry if it's not exact. As long as it's within 500 of 29800 , it's an acceptable value. If both sensors return an acceptable value, proceed to the next step. Next, check the sensor readings when connected to the pneumatic system. Push the vacuum line onto the VAC1 sensor. Install the N045 nozzle tip onto the nozzle. Next, turn on the pump for nozzle 1 and its valve using these commands: M106 ;turn on pump 1 M106 P1 S255 ;turn on valve 1 With the pump and valve on, read the pressure from the first vacuum sensor: M3426 G2 C1 I1 A110 You should read a value of about 15500 . Don't worry if it's not exact. As long as it's within 13000 - 18000 , it's an acceptable value. Record this number. Now, cover the tip of the nozzle with your finger and re-run the command. Make sure the pump and valve are still running. Record this number. Turn off the pump and valve using the following commands: M107 ;turn off the pump M107 P1 ;turn off the valve You should read a value that is around 2000 less than the uncovered value. Record this number. Remove the vacuum tube from VAC1 and install it onto VAC2 . Repeat steps 9, 10, and 11 again to check the second sensor. You'll need to use M3426 G2 C2 I1 A110 to read the pressure from the second sensor instead of the first. Remove the vacuum tube from VAC2 and install it back onto VAC1 . If any of the sensor values were not in the acceptable range, re-assess the soldering joints of the interposer board onto the motherboard and make sure they're all connected with a solid joint. If you are still unable to get a good reading, please reach out to our support line and we'll make sure you get up and running.","title":"REV03 Mobo Interposer Guide"},{"location":"misc/maintenance-upgrades/rev3-vac-interposer/#rev03-motherboard-interposer-installation-guide","text":"This guide is for installing the Vacuum Sensor Interposer Boards .

Record this number. Remove the vacuum tube from VAC1 and install it onto VAC2 . Repeat steps 9, 10, and 11 again to check the second sensor. You'll need to use M3426 G2 C2 I1 A110 to read the pressure from the second sensor instead of the first. Remove the vacuum tube from VAC2 and install it back onto VAC1 . If any of the sensor values were not in the acceptable range, re-assess the soldering joints of the interposer board onto the motherboard and make sure they're all connected with a solid joint.

Fortunately, most of these issues only need to be addressed once, and so once you've successfully placed components on your FTP, you'll have done the vast majority of the setup work needed to fine-tune your machine. After that, populating new PCBs on your LumenPnP will simply be a matter of setting up the board and feeder locations. Hopefully, you'll see a pattern to the placement errors on your machine. If that's the case, look at the list of Symptoms and narrow down the possible causes so that you only have to check some of the Solutions .","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"misc/troubleshooting/diagnostic-routines/","text":"Diagnostic Routines If you're having trouble picking and placing components but are having a hard time narrowing down the list of possibilities for what could be going wrong, this list of routines might help you find the culprit. The idea is to have you follow simple test steps to show the problem in limited situations so you have fewer possible root causes to check and solve. Motion System Check The LumenPnP uses a lot of different offsets and calibrations for using its cameras to make precise movements. This test ignores those, and only tests the physical motion system of the machine. Jog the machine until the top camera is positioned somewhere recognizable, such as over a feeder. This will be your starting point. Next, pick another recognizable location as a target destination. For example, pick one of the component locations on your board. Make sure that neither of the locations you picked require that you click a button in OpenPnP that uses the cameras to find fiducial markers. We want to avoid that during this test. Move the machine back and forth between these two locations at least 5 times. Note which axes move: X, Y, and or Z. If the machine correctly travels repeatably to these two locations each time, then your motion system is likely healthy. The test has succeeded. If the machine does NOT correctly travel to these two locations repeatably, then something is wrong with your motion system. Check the following: Check the X, Y, Z axis belt tension Check the X, Y, Z axis motor pulleys to make sure they're not loose Check the stepper motors to make sure they're not overheating Check that the top camera isn't loose Check that the staging plate isn't loose Check that the tool head isn't crashing to reach one of the jog locations Toolhead offset check Incorrect tool head offsets will cause pick and place operations to fail. This test tunes the tool head offset directly without any use of computer vision or the cameras themselves. It is recommended to run the Motion System Check first before this test to rule out motion system repeatability issues first. Load one of your tray feeders Position the camera over the feeder location Switch to positioning the nozzle over the feeder location Look at the nozzle and see if it's position is in line with what you saw on the camera feed in step 2 If not, adjust the toolhead offset by 0.05mm at a time.

Try jogging to your homing fiducial and see if the camera is centered on it (Found under Machine Setup -> Heads -> ReferenceHead H1 and clicking on the \"Jog camera to position\" button next to the Homing Fiducal coordinates). If not, it's likely that the machine has skipped steps. Rehome the machine to solve this issue. You can set soft limits in the Machine Setup > Axes menus. Incorrect Toolhead Offset If the offset of the nozzle tip to the top camera is set incorrectly, the machine will place parts slightly offset from where they should be and may not pick them up correctly. Redo the Nozzle Offset Calibration to solve this issue. You may also tweak the values manually in OpenPnP under Machine Setup -> Heads -> ReferenceHead H1 -> Nozzles -> ReferenceNozzle N1 -> Offset Wizard -> Nozzle head offsets . Bad Fiducial Scan It's possible that when OpenPnP scans for the fiducials on your PCB, it actually found a bright section of silkscreen or another pad, and that shifted all the placements on your board. Rerun your fiducial scan and check to see if OpenPnP is correctly finding the fiducial. Instructions for tuning a vision pipeline for fiducials can be found here . Incorrect Feeder Z Position Picking can sometimes fail if the nozzle is either too far away from the part, or too close. Jog your nozzle tip about 1mm above a part in your feeder, and turn on the PV actuator to activate the vacuum. Now, slowly jog the Z axis down 0.1mm until you see the part jump onto the tip, and hear the pump strain against the vacuum. Jog one final 0.1mm down after this, and set your feeder Z position to your current Z position. Paste Inside Nozzle Tip Sometimes the nozzle tip may dip into a bit of solder paste on your PCB. This can cause a blockage and prevent a part from being picked correctly. If you're finding that parts refuse to stick to your nozzle, try checking the nozzle tip for a blockage and clear it out with some small gauge wire, or some pressurized air. Pick Dwell Time Too Short If OpenPnP does not give the machine enough time to pull a proper vacuum and grab the part before moving the nozzle tip away from the pick location, the part can fail to pick. Try increasing the pick dwell time for the nozzle tip you're using under Machine Setup -> Nozzle Tips -> ReferenceNozzleTip N__ -> Dwell Times -> Pick Dwell Time Place Dwell Time Too Short If OpenPnP does not give the machine enough time to release the vacuum and drop the part onto the board before moving the nozzle tip away from the place location, the part can fail to place. Try increasing the place dwell time for the nozzle tip you're using under Machine Setup -> Nozzle Tips -> ReferenceNozzleTip N__ -> Dwell Times -> Place Dwell Time Board Z Height Incorrect If the Board Z Height is set too high, the nozzle will not press the part firmly into the solder paste which helps it stay in place. Try tuning your board's Z position by bring it down in 0.1mm increments and testing placements between each tweak to see if parts are being pushed into the paste more firmly. Brass Nozzle Holder Loose If not tightened into the motor properly, sometimes the brass nozzle holder can come loose and cause incorrect placements. Ensure that your nozzle holder is tightened into the hollow shaft stepper motor tightly. Loose Pulley Check the pulleys attached to each motor for play. While the machine is powered and homed, try pushing or pulling on the X, Y, and Z axes. If the axis can be moved by hand back and forth without causing the motor to skip steps, then the pulley on that axis probably needs to be tightened down onto the motor shaft. Power off the LumenPnP Loosen the belt tension for the axis you're working on Remove the motor from its mount Check that the pulley is fully secured Tighten the grub screws holding the pulley on the motor shaft Reinstall the motor Re-tighten the timing belt Power on the LumenPnP Home the machine Make sure that the play in that axis is gone. Belt Tension If the nozzle or camera is failing to repeatably move to the same position, it's likely that one of your timing belts do not have sufficient tension. Check the belt tensioner arms on the X and both Y axis and ensure they're tight, and difficult to pull away from the machine any further. USB Hub Overload Some computers' internal USB controllers are unable to process a webcam feed from both webcams through the same USB port. If you are unable to get both webcams to appear in OpenPnP, try unplugging one from the motherboard and plugging it directly into your computer. For more information about this, check out the camera testing section of the assembly instructions. Camera Drop-Down Selected If you're finding that trying to manually jog the Z axis of your machine does not work, check the drop-down in the \"Machine Controls\" section of the UI underneath the cameras, and select the Nozzle instead of the Camera. This should allow you to jog your Z axis. Bottom Vision Error See bottom vision pipeline adjustment. Check Vacuum Pump Press down on the quick connect coupler P Pull out the plastic tubing from your tool head. Turn on the vacuum pump Turn on the valve Put your finger over the end of the tubing If you can't feel suction: You may have a leak in the tubing You may have wired your pump or valve incorrectly Your valve or pump may be damaged, check the noises they make Check Board Rotation Re-run the board fiducials Check various placement locations by moving the camera over them to make sure they're set correctly.

Vision is used in four main places: Finding your homing fiducial Finding the fiducial marks on your PCBs Finding the tips of your nozzles, and Confirming and orienting the parts the machine has picked up. We've included good settings in the default machine configuration to get you started, but you will likely need to tune the settings for your exact needs depending on the ambient light in your room, the settings you used when configuring your cameras , and the kinds of components you're placing. This page is to get you set up to place components for your FTP , and learn the basics of how adjusting computer vision works. For more information, we highly recommend reading the OpenPnP documentation . Intro to Vision Tuning Computer Vision Basics Computer vision used in OpenPnP takes photos from your top or bottom camera and passes them through a \"Pipeline\" of stages to identify what is in the image. Stages fall into a few categories: Manipulating the photo to make it easier for the computer to identify parts of the photo. For example: Threshold . Identifying certain elements of the photo. For example: DetectCirclesHough . Showing you more information on the screen so that you can build, debug, and tweak the pipeline. For example: DrawCircles . Because each of these kinds of stages live together in the pipeline, it can be a little confusing trying to decode how each stage works and what they're for. Each stage of the pipeline has \"parameters\" that control its function. For example, the ImageWriteDebug step will ask you for parts of a file name to use when saving a debug image. Another more typical example is the Threshold stage, which will use a threshold parameter to pick which parts of your image will become white, and which will become black. When editing your vision pipeline, you should be able to start with simply tuning the parameters for the stages in the default pipeline. As you get more experienced, and if you're setting up more complicated placement jobs, you may need to add more stages to the pipeline to fine tune it for your needs. Pipeline Organization As of the 2022-08-01_18-07-09.2a36a8d update, OpenPnP added the \"Vision\" tab in the Machine Configuration section, which lets you create more specific pipelines for unique scenarios. Now you can define multiple specific pipelines to handle identification of different PCB components differently if you're not able to build a single pipeline to accommodate them all. This adds more functionality, but can be confusing when getting started. In general we recommend having four main pipelines to get started (when doing the FTP and beyond): Finding your homing fiducial (Top Camera) Finding the fiducial marks on your PCBs (Top Camera) Finding the tips of your nozzles (Bottom Camera) Confirming and orienting the parts the machine has picked up. (Bottom Camera) Number 4 above is the one that you might expand when you move on to placing more complicated components. Note also that this \"Vision\" tab is brand new in OpenPnP, and so guidance here is subject to change as the new feature gets refined in future OpenPnP releases. Pipeline Editing View The pipeline editing view has several sections and features you should know about to make your tuning go more smoothly. The list of stages. Click on a stage to show it's results in the main view, and show its parameters in the stage settings. The main view. This shows the result of the currently selected stage unless a particular stage is pinned (see #5). Stage output. This shows error messages if there's a problem with your stage or pipeline. Stage settings. This lets you change the settings for the selected stage. Pin Image. This lets you keep the results of the currently selected stage on on main view, even if you select another stage. Use this to pin a debugging stage so that you can quickly see the results of changes to a stage you're editing. Top Camera Vision Pipeline Homing Fiducials If you find that the machine is having a hard time finding the homing fiducial, you might need to edit the Vision Pipeline. The iterative strategy here is: Open the Pipeline. Check the current output and identify the problem that is causing homing to fail. Adjust the stage settings to change the pipeline output. Review the new pipeline output. Return to step 2 as necessary. Open the Pipeline Click on the Machine Setup tab in the top right pane. Click on the \"Expand\" checkbox if necessary. Click on Heads > ReferenceHead H1 . Click on the \"Position Camera over location\" icon button show below. This will move the top camera to where your datum board is mounted. Confirm that your top camera is positioned exactly over the homing fiducial. Adjust the exposure of your camera image as mentioned in the Homing Fiducial Section . Go to the Vision tab. Select on FiducialVision from the type dropdown. Select - Default Machine Fiducial Locator - from the pipeline list. Click on Pipeline Edit . Check the debug results Click on the DrawCircles stage. The main view will show a circle if OpenPnP was able to identify what it thinks is the homing fiducial. If there are more than one circle, then we need to more clearly distinguish the real homing fiducial. If there is one circle, but it is not correctly drawn around the homing fiducial, then we need to more clearly distinguish the homing fiducial. If there are no circles, we need to loosen the filtering to make the real homing fiducial easier to identify. If the image looks like the good one above, your pipeline is properly tuned. If you've still been getting failures when homing, you may need to slightly loosen the filtering. Adjust Pipeline Click on the Threshold stage Raise or lower the threshold parameter as necessary until the image is precise. If the image is too black, raise the threshold setting. If the image is too bright, lower the threshold setting. Click on the DrawCircles stage and check if the fiducial has been correctly identified. If not, pin the view of the DrawCircles stage. Click on the DetectCirclesHough stage. Raise or lower the param2 parameter as necessary until the correct number of circles are identified. If there are no circles, lower the param2 setting. If there are too many circles, raise the param2 setting. Review Pipeline Output When the fiducial is correctly identified, close the pipeline editor. When prompted, save the edits you've made. Try homing the machine to see if it can identify the homing fiducial. PCB Fiducials Go to the Vision tab. Select on FiducialVision from the type dropdown. Select FIDUCIAL-1X2 from the pipeline list. Click on Pipeline Edit . Continue with the same procedure as the Homing fiducial section above.","title":"Vision Pipeline Adjustment"},{"location":"misc/troubleshooting/vision-pipeline-adjustment/#intro-to-vision-tuning","text":"","title":"Intro to Vision Tuning"},{"location":"misc/troubleshooting/vision-pipeline-adjustment/#computer-vision-basics","text":"Computer vision used in OpenPnP takes photos from your top or bottom camera and passes them through a \"Pipeline\" of stages to identify what is in the image.

By default OpenPnP will pause a job and wait for you to manually change a nozzle tip, but it can be more efficient to set up automatic tool changing. Perform the following optional steps for each of the nozzle tips you'll be switching between. We recommend reading the OpenPnP Wiki page about this as well. Insert the labeled nozzle tips into the holder in their respectively labeled slots. Apply some lubricant to the end of your nozzle holder with the lubrication packet included with your nozzles. This is important for repeatably fully attaching the nozzles without damaging the rubber O-rings around the holder. Click on the Machine Setup tab in the top right pane. Click on the \"Expand\" checkbox to open all of the features about your machine. Select the nozzle you're working with. For example: Nozzle Tips > ReferenceNozzleTipN045 Select the Tool Changer tab. Capturing Positions Now we can start capturing positions. Automatic nozzle changing works by replaying four position commands either forward or backward to load or unload a nozzle tip, respectively. We're going to start with the last position, because it's easiest for getting our Z height correct. Note that the instructions below are for the N045 nozzle tip, but you should use whichever tip you're setting up. Warning Be careful not to crash your nozzle tip or toolhead into any of the components mounted on your staging plate, especially the nozzle holder. Be especially careful if you have high amounts of backlash compensation, which can cause your tool head to move in unexpected directions when jogging to eliminate backlash. Be aware of your machine's Safe Z axis settings as well, as they can cause the tool head to raise between moves to avoid crashing, which may actually be undesirable here. Install the N045 nozzle onto the tool head by hand. Jog the nozzle until it is directly in front of the N045 slot in the tool changer. Adjust the Z height until it's clear it'll slide into the rack. Double-check the toolhead is aligned with the slot in the Y axis so that only a X movement would be necessary to slot it into place. It may be a good idea to test-fit the nozzle into the slot by jogging the X axis only. Capture the nozzle position for the Last Location . Move the nozzle into the slot by jogging the X axis in 0.1mm increments. Try to ensure there's no lateral strain on the nozzle holder in the Y axis. Continue until the nozzle is fully slotted into the nozzle holder. Capture the Third Location nozzle position. The next position is for making sure that the nozzle tip is completely seated on the CP40 holder during insertion. Jog the Z axis down approximately two millimeters. The spring in the CP40 holder will take up these few millimeters to avoid damage to the tool head. You may find that a larger or smaller movement gets the nozzle tip seated completely, so feel free to experiment. Capture the Second Location nozzle position. Now jog the Z axis up 30 millimeters. This is the clearance position where the nozzle holder is getting ready for the plunge. Capture the First Location nozzle position. You can now play through the positions by clicking on the \"move nozzle to position\" buttons in order. Tune any values in the fields as necessary to ensure you get a clean and straight insertion. Apply the changes to the tool changing positions. Repeat the above steps for each of the nozzles you're using. See also the \"Cloning Settings\" section in the OpenPnP docs .

Connect your LumenPnP to your computer using the included USB cable Open OpenPnP on your computer. You should now see the OpenPnP UI: Com Port and Baud Rate Before connecting to the LumenPnP, you need to set which USB port to use for communication in OpenPnP. Click on the Machine Setup tab. Click on the \"Expand\" checkbox to open all of the features. Under Drivers click on GcodeDriver GcodeDriver . Below the list of machine settings you'll find the details of the GcodeDriver. In the Configuration tab, check the Baud and Port settings. Set the Baud to 115200 On Windows, Set the Port to the option in the format: COM2 . On Mac, Set the Port to the option in the format: cu.usbmodem<a-lot-of-numbers> On Linux, Set the Port to the option in the format: ttyACM0 . Port Not Found If your machine's port does not show up in the drop down, check that your USB cable is plugged in to both your computer and the LumenPnP. Also check that the motherboard is powered on. If you still cannot find the port, try pressing the reset button on the motherboard and closing and reopening OpenPnP. Click Apply in the lower right corner to save your changes. Bottom Camera Config Now we'll set up the cameras. The big red \"X\" in the camera views means that OpenPnP isn't receiving the webcam feed. We'll specify which webcam is which. Camera Connection Issues (v2 Hardware) Because the motherboard in v2 LumenPnP kit machines has a built in USB hub you can plug both of the webcams into the motherboard, and then connect the motherboard to your computer with a single one USB cable. This keeps cables tidy, but it sends a lot of data through one single USB port on your computer. Unfortunately, from reports we've gotten from users, it seems that not all computer manufacturers include high-quality internal USB hubs. The lower quality hubs included in these computers can't handle the bandwidth requirements of two webcams plus the motherboard all on a single USB port. If this is the case for your computer, one or both of the webcams will be missing from the configuration list in OpenPnP or any other camera application. If you have this problem, you will need to plug at least one of the webcams directly into your computer via a separate USB port. Occasionally this can cause the webcam's name to be incorrect, but you'll still be able to select it from the drop-down list with a little trial and error. In the top-left corner, change the camera view to one of the \"Show All\" options. You should then see two camera feeds that are black, and have red X's on them.

The big red \"X\" in the camera views means that OpenPnP isn't receiving the webcam feed. We'll specify which webcam is which. Camera Connection Issues (v2 Hardware) Because the motherboard in v2 LumenPnP kit machines has a built in USB hub you can plug both of the webcams into the motherboard, and then connect the motherboard to your computer with a single one USB cable. This keeps cables tidy, but it sends a lot of data through one single USB port on your computer. Unfortunately, from reports we've gotten from users, it seems that not all computer manufacturers include high-quality internal USB hubs. The lower quality hubs included in these computers can't handle the bandwidth requirements of two webcams plus the motherboard all on a single USB port. If this is the case for your computer, one or both of the webcams will be missing from the configuration list in OpenPnP or any other camera application. If you have this problem, you will need to plug at least one of the webcams directly into your computer via a separate USB port. Occasionally this can cause the webcam's name to be incorrect, but you'll still be able to select it from the drop-down list with a little trial and error.

Tip OpenPnP has some new methods of calibration using a secondary fiducial at a different Z height, and a small piece of paper. If you'd like to explore this method of calibration, you can find the OpenPnP docs about this process here . This process requires making and installing a calibration rig , 3D Units per Pixel calibration , and Advanced Camera Calibration . Install an N045 nozzle on the left toolhead.

Read the instructions that OpenPnP provides in this window. This guide will use the homing fiducial as the starting point, instead of using putty or flour. But those are valid strategies as well if you'd prefer them. Select the Nozzle: N1 - N045 (Head:H1) from the machine controls dropdown. Jog the nozzle so that it is just barely touching the datum board, and perfectly centered over the homing fiducial. We recommend looking for the shiny edge of the gold fiducial poking out from under the nozzle tip to determine if you've centered it correctly. Click Store nozzle mark position . Do not navigate away from the Heads > ReferenceHead H1 > Nozzles > ReferenceNozzle N1 tab while running the wizard. Raise the nozzle off the datum board. Jog the X and Y axes to bring the top camera directly centered over the homing fiducial. Again, do not switch away from the Offset Wizard tab. After centering the homing fiducial in the top camera view, click Calculate nozzle offset . Click Apply to save the nozzle offset change. If you have a v3 semi-assembled LumenPnP machine, start again from step 1 to calibrate your right nozzle.

If you follow these steps you will have a slightly easier time setting the location of the board in OpenPnP, but if you need to set up a board somewhere else on the staging plates, that is totally fine, too. Loosely screw in the universal mounting components in the following locations: Static Board Mount positioned diagonally, screwed into B28 Dynamic Board Mount positioned vertically, screwed into D28 Dynamic Board Mount positioned horizontally, screwed into B30 Board Support placed in E31 Cut strips of double-sided tape and apply them to the top of the FTP board. Do not cover the fiducial markers, but make sure that each of the pads are covered by tape. The double-sided tape lets the components stick to the board so that you can do a \"mock\" run of a placement job without dealing with solder paste. Place the FTP board in the holders and push them so that they're snug against the sides of the board. Tighten down the holders. You shouldn't be able to move the board except by pressing on the tab holding it in place. If you installed your holders in this location, the bottom left corner of your FTP board should be located around X328, Y94. Finding the FTP Location The next step is to set the physical location of the FTP board in OpenPNP. You'll start by setting an approximate location and then fine tune the location using vision. Once the location is set, you can run the job to pick and place components. You'll likely need to go through these steps a few times to tune the settings. Navigate to the Job tab in the top-right pane. In the bottom-right pane, you'll see the Placements panel. Find the three elements with the IDs: FID1 , FID2 , and FID3 . You can sort the list by Part to find them easily. For each of the three elements, go to the Type column, select where it says Placement and switch it to Fiducial . This tells OpenPnP that these three elements on the board are not components to be picked and placed, but fiducials to be scanned. Back in the top-right pane, double-click on the X and Y values of 0.000 and change them to X328 and Y94 respectively. This will be the rough location of the bottom-left corner of the FTP board. Get the Z axis coordinate used when setting up the feeders, subtract 0.10 from it, and enter the result into the Z coordinate for the board. Setting the Z slightly lower than the actual board height allows the spring-loaded nozzle holder to lightly press components into the board to make them stick. Click the \"Position Camera on Board\" icon button and check that the center of the camera feed is very roughly lined up with the bottom-left corner of the FTP board. In the lower-right pane, select one of the fiducials to highlight it. Click the \"Position Camera\" icon button to move the top camera over the fiducial location. The alignment will probably not be perfect. To fix this, click on the digital readout in the bottom right corner to zero your current position. Then, move the tool head with the Jog buttons until the fiducial is centered in the reticle. Read the relative XY position you've moved your tool head, and add those values to the board's X and Y positions. Do not change the position of the fiducial itself in the lower-right pane list as that will throw off the rest of the placements. Only adjust the location of the board itself, not the components relative to each other. In the lower-right panel, select the other fiducial points in turn, and check their location with the \"position camera\" icon button. If all the fiducials are close to the reticle center, you're ready to run a fiducial scan to get the exact location of your FTP board. If only the first fiducial is centered, your board is probably rotated (ie the bottom edge is not parallel with the X axis). You can still move on to the fiducial scan, but you may need to manually readjust the board so that it is straighter. Click on the \"Fiducial Scan for Location\" button. This will automatically move the camera to each of the fiducial locations and use the camera to try to identify the center of the fiducial. If it can find all three, it will automatically update the position and rotation of the board relative to the LumenPnP gantry. If the fiducial check fails, here are some options for moving forward: You might need to rotate the FTP board to be more square to the LumenPnP motion system. You may need to adjust your vision pipeline . If you'd prefer, you can also fall back on manually defining the board's location using the \"Multiple Placements\" icon button. To double-check the board's location, rerun the fiducial scan. It is also useful to select some of the other placement locations and move the camera to them as well to check that the camera is centered between the metal pads. If the camera is not lining up correctly, see Troubleshooting for help getting things more tightly set up. Placing Components Make sure you've pulled back the protective tape cover on your feeders and that you have the correct nozzle installed. It's time to place your first component. Press the \"Single job step\" icon button repeatedly until OpenPnP moves to pick up an LED, check it's orientation over the bottom camera, and then place it on the board. If the component was not picked up correctly, you will need to adjust your feeder location or height . If the component was not identified by the bottom camera correctly, you will likely need to adjust its vision pipeline . If the component did not stick to the FTP board, you should lower the FTP board's Z axis location ( 0.10mm increments are a good starting place). If the component stuck to the FTP board but was not centered on placement location (on the metal pads), you will need to do some fine tuning. It is useful to place five or so components before attempting to diagnose exactly what's wrong with your placements. Continue to click the \"Single Job Step\" to place the additional components (or click the \"Play\" icon button and pause the operation when you're ready.) It is perfectly normal for your very first set of component placements to have some errors. There are several different sources of placement error that we can address, one at a time.
